Internet of things is the communication of anything with any other things. The door plays an important role in home security. So, providing a secured garage door system for  houses has become a vital research. The goal is to implement   a home security system by integrating smart phone and IOT.   IOT is used remotely to view the activity and get a notification when there is a presence of a nearby object and someone    tries to access garage door.   Here, Raspberry Pi, ultrasonic sensor etc. are utilized to provide an alarming system that has the ability to notify the owner and allow the owner to access to unlock and lock door through mobile app and stores the time and duration of each activity to the database so that the owner can track usability of vehicles and things by the family members and usability of garage. It also helps the owner to protect the garage from the intruder. Smart Garage Door lock also allows to reduce the fuel consumption by vehicle and reduce time wastage by providing easy access to unlock door.
